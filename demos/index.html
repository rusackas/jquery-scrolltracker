  <h2>Demos</h2>

  <p>There are two demos herein, one for <a href="vertical/index.html">vertical</a> (the default setting) and <a href="horizontal/index.html">horizontal</a>. Each shows the classes that are added to the tracked element(s). These classes are then displayed in the tracked elements with CSS, which also recolors them according to position.</p>

  <p>Note that you can also set the direction option to "both" when initializing the plugin, which tracks objects in both directions, adding two classes in doing so.</p>
